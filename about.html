                                My "Product" is the ESPN Tournament Challenge, which is a service offered by ESPN that allows participants to fill out brackets for March Madness and compete amongst celebrities and friends to see who can get the most games picked correctly. My overall
                                design Strategy was one where I wanted the visitor to be able to learn about and be interested in the service before they commit to anything. The user is able to interact with the page in a number of ways before they have
                                to decide to sign up. The user can watch videos, interact with maps, print a bracket, or learn how to play without having to commit to the strategy. My goal was to provide lots of visual elements that the user would be
                                interested in, hopefully encouraging the visitor to subscribe to the service after completing the tour of the site.

                                Awareness is achieved by the Jumbotron. From the moment the page loads, the viewer is presented with the core purpose of the page. As the user looks at the main section of the page, they see a number of indicators of what the page is promoting, including
                                buttons and cards describing the content right below the jumbotron.

                                Interest is drawn in a number of ways. A few of the more obvious ones include the buttons that allow the user to see the bracket before they fill it out, as well as the ability to print the bracket and fill it out at home. Also included in the landing
                                page is a Youtube video designed to get them interested in the event, as well as a collpasable How to Play section similar to this about page. Finally, a manueverable map is present for the user to see the location of the
                                Final Four.

                                Desire comes from the Youtube video, which acts as a hype up video for the event. The user watches the video and is interested in competing in the event. Desire also comes from the interactibility of the page, with the user being able to view a bracket
                                before they fill one out, so they can see the posibilites of who is in the bracket before having to commit to anything.

                                Action comes in the form of the sign up buttons, the Jumbotron has one right below the main title, while there is also one in the sticky navbar the presents the user a way to always know they have the ability to sign up. Upon clicking the sign up button,
                                they are taken to the action page where they can fill out all the information needed by ESPN. Unfortunately, the user isn't able to sign up to the event through the website, but they are taken to the page where they would
                                be able to upon completing the form.
