If you want to play with a specific group of people you know, you may create a private group and make it only accessible to those whom you have given the group password (use the "Invite Friends" page to invite them to the Private Group and it will include the password in the invitation). The creator of a group sets the group's name, motto and password. You can move your entry from one group to the next as long as it is before the first game of the tournament or if the group is not a Locked group. All of this is easily found in the Group Directory.

                <p class="champ"> The Alamo Dome is the site of this year's Final Four. The Alamodome is a domed 64,000-seat, multi-purpose facility used as a football, basketball, soccer, baseball stadium, and convention center. It is located on the southeastern fringe of Downtown San Antonio, Texas.</p>
                <p class="champ"> The multi-purpose facility was intended to increase the city's convention traffic and attract a professional football franchise. It also placated the San Antonio Spurs' demands for a larger arena. </p>
                <p class="champ">
                    The stadium was designed to easily convert into a basketball or hockey arena. Converting the stadium for basketball and hockey takes 12–18 hours to set up retractable seating and installing the playing surface. In this configuration, typically only the two lower levels at one or both ends are used. The arena configuration seats 20,662 spectators, but is expandable to 39,500 when the upper level is opened.
                </p>
                <p class="champ">
                    The Alamodome opened with 38 luxury suites and 6,000 club level seats. The original design specifications called for 66 luxury suites. However, since the Spurs were the only full-time tenant at the time, only 38 luxury suites in the north end of the facility were built. The footprints for the 28 unbuilt luxury suites were open floor space just behind the club level seats that surround the south end of the facility. In 2006, the Alamodome underwent an expansion to accommodate 14 new luxury suites.
